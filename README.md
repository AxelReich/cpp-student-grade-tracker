GradeSystem
Overview
The GradeSystem project is a simple C++ application that manages student grade reports for various courses. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory management. The application supports multiple student types, including Biology, Theater, and Computer Science students.

Features:
Import student data: Read student details from a file.
Dynamic memory management: Create and store students dynamically based on their course type.
Polymorphism: Use virtual functions to handle different student types through a unified interface.
Grade report generation: Display or export detailed reports of student performance.
How to Build and Run
Prerequisites
A C++ compiler that supports C++11 (e.g., g++ or clang++).
A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
make build tool.
Build Steps
Clone or download the repository.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd GradeSystem
Build the project:

bash
Copy code
make
This will create:

Object files in the build/ directory.
The final executable student_program in the bin/ directory.
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
./bin/student_program
Targets in the Makefile
Default (make): Compiles the entire project and produces the executable.
make students: Compiles only the object files and places them in the build/ directory.
make clean: Removes all compiled files (build/ and bin/).
File Input Format
The application expects student data in a specific format when importing from a file:

plaintext
Copy code
<number_of_students>
<last_name>,<first_name>
<course_type>
<grades>
<last_name>,<first_name>
<course_type>
<grades>
...
Example Input

Key Classes
Student (Base Class)

Contains common attributes like name and course type.
Provides a virtual method to calculate grades.
BiologyStudent, TheaterStudent, ComputerScienceStudent (Derived Classes)

Inherit from Student.
Override methods to handle course-specific grade calculations.
StudentList

Manages a dynamic array of Student objects.
Handles importing data, resizing the array, and managing memory.
Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
Extend the grading system to include more student types and course categories.
Add unit tests in the tests/ directory to ensure program correctness.
